## Coding Style
- Use ES6 Javascript features in the application
- Import statement divided (by extra spaces) into external library and internal files
- Do not use semicolon at the end of statement or import
- Variable naming should use camelCase style
- Use only let and const in declaring a variable
- Use single quote (') for string import, variable instead of double quote (")
- Always put code into component class when it is reusable
- Do not put a duplicate variable name that can confuse the usage
